# Dual Frequency Enhancement for Dense Texture Reconstruction in Image Demosaicking
Implementation of "Dual Frequency Enhancement for Dense Texture Reconstruction in Image Demosaicking"

# Dataset 
## Description
We generate LineSet38 dataset for image demosaicking. The generated images feature complex line patterns, which are prone to severe distortions like color moire after demosaicking. Raw input can be synthesized according to the Bayer pattern.
